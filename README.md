# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

The main purpose of this analysis is to provide the company with the total number of retiring employees and the number of employees who are eligible for their mentorship program. Tables were created for each report that included relevant data, including namess, birthdates, titles, start date, and end date.

## Results


**Retiring Table**

**Mentorship Eleigibility Table**

Based on the two tables created above, there are 4 assumptions we can conclude:

* Almost 70% of the Retireees are Senior Engineers and Senior Staff so most of the hiring resources need to be allocated for these positions
* There are only 2 Managers retiring so backfilling these roles may be relatively quicker than other positions
* There are only 1549 current employees who qualify for the Mentorship program to potentially fill the the Retiring Employees
* There is a large difference between the number of retiring employees and the number of employees eligible for mentorship. Therefore, the company will still need to focus a majority of their resources in hiring externally

## Summary

As the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact in the company, a total of 72,458 positions will need to be backfilled. Based on the tables above, there are not enough Mentors for all of the retiring employees. Moving forward, the company may be wise to create a retiring table for each year to anticipate and prepare for the next "silver tsunami." Furthermore, a new query can be created to analyze the age distribution within the company. This may provide beneficial insight into their hiring strategies in the future.
